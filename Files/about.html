                        <h3>History</h3>
                        <p>
                            IT Centre was established in the year 2000 to create a Campus Wide Network by
                            interconnecting various campuses and departments.

                            First phase which was completed in April 2001, networked 18 departments having 524 nodes.
                            Second phase was completed in Oct 2002, which connected ten more departments and installed
                            331 additional nodes. During third phase we have connected IET and Nalanda Campus to our
                            central server located at IT Centre, Khandwa Road Campus. IET has been connected by laying
                            2.1 kilometer fibre optic cable where as Nalanda Campus which is six kilometer away from
                            Khandwa Road Campus has been connected using 10 Mbps leased line.

                            During third phase expansion additional 150 nodes have been added to Nalanda Campus, RNT
                            Marg Network and 128 nodes to IET network.

                            After completion of third phase i.e. from Feb, 2004 all the departments of the University
                            are now on Campus LAN having access to the Internet.

                            Under UGC-INFONET scheme, from Jan 2004, UGC has provided our University free subscription
                            to the various e-Journals along with 2 mbps bandwidth through ERNET
