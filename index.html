                <section>
                    <p>Devi Ahilya University established Information Technology Centre (I.T. Centre) in year 2000 with
                        an objective to create world class ICT infrastructure to facilitate Networking, Internet
                        Services and Solutions for fulfilling Teaching, Research and Governance Goals of the University.
                    </p>

                    <p>IT Centre successfully installed and commissioned its campus wide network in year 2000 covering
                        all University Teaching Departments (UTDs) and sections. The university has about 5000 network
                        connections and 9000+ users covering more than twenty buildings across three campuses. The
                        university campus network named as DAVVNET consists of three different networks <br>
                    <ul style="list-style: none;">
                        <li>i) Campus wide Network (45 departments/sections, three campuses)</li>

                    </p>

                    <p>University is providing Internet services to its students, faculty and staff on using 1 Gbps
                        Internet lease line connectivity of National Knowledge Network (NKN). This connectivity along
                        with developed IT infrastructure has been successfully used in conducting several online
                        interactive workshops held under NMEICT. These workshops were remotely conducted by IIT Bombay
                        and IIT Kharagpur in different engineering streams on various subjects. Virtual class room has
                        been created in IET (a university teaching department) for the same.</p>

                    <p>University is running several IT and network support services such as email and web service,
                        Firewall services for access control, LDAP as authentication service, DNS for name to IP
                        resolution. These services are centrally managed by IT Centre. The University provides its
                        information technology resources to a large and varied group, including faculty, staff, and
                        students. All users are expected to use these resources in an efficient and ethical manner.</p>

                    <p>Several University e-Governance services are also made available through University web portal.
                        These services are online admissions, results, registrations, various forms and fess submission.
                        All these services are user and student centric.</p>

                    <p>The uncontrolled and free web access gives rise to activities that obstruct the network speed and
                        uniform access to all users. In view of this the University recently formulated its IT Policy,
                        that works as course of action for using University’s computing facilities including computer
                        hardware, software, email, intranet and internet access collectively in disciplined and ethical
                        manner.
                    </p>
                    <h3 style="font-size: 20px; ">Wi-Fi Network at DAVV</h3>
                    <p>The Wi-Fi connectivity in DAVV campus started in year 2006 when university hostels were connected
                        to DAVV network for providing Internet access to students. The 8 hostels were connected to IT
                        Centre using Wi-Fi connectivity.</p>

                    <p>Takshashila campus, the academic campus of DAVV is also equipped with campus Wi-fi connectivity.
                        It is mainly covering several UTDs. The Wi-Fi network was commissioned and made operational in
                        May 2012. It is latest Motorola based network controllers, Indoor and Outdoor Access points.
                        Campus Wi-Fi campus network covers around 70% of Campus area. University has invested about Rs.
                        25 lac for the same.</p>
                    <p>
                        It is upgraded under NMEICT scheme. The hostel LAN is connecting all hostels (12 in number) of
                        the University. Optical fibre backbone is created, which interconnects all hostels to IT Centre.
                        The structured cabling work of 2000 LAN points within the hostels has been completed. This
                        network will facilitate 1 LAN point to every student resident in the hostel. Apart from the
                        wired connectivity, Wi-Fi connectivity within hostels is also provided to cover open area of the
                        hostel buildings. The students and faculty members are actively using this facility. In the year
                        2017-18 2600 I/O Points were upgraded also Wi-Fi Networking & Structured LAN cabling work has
                        been done in UTDs and Hostels. The network connectivity is satisfactorily maintained based on
                        the regular feedback obtained from users.</p>
